What are the chances that they will go home with \\$250, and how many bets might they expect to make before winning or losing?  Write a program that reads three values from the user: the initial stake (in my example \\$50), the goal amount (in my example \\$250), and the number of times we want to simulate the game.  Your program then simulates the game - betting until the player either reaches their set goal or loses all their money.  The simulation of one game (flip the coin until the player reaches the goal or goes broke) should be in a function named game(stake, goal)   This function should return two values, the number of bets placed during the game and whether or not the game ended in a win for the player.  After implementing game, do a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability that the player will win, and the average number of bets they make before winning or losing.  Your MonteCarlo simulation should make calls to your function\n","game(stake, goal).\n","Part of the point of this exercise is to organize your code using functions.  You must use the function headers I have provided and implement the functions to make them do what the comment say they do.   You may NOT modify the main function I have provided - you must write the functions game and simulate so that they work correctly with the main function.\n","\n","B.\tExperiment with running your code see what patterns you can find.  How likely is it that the gambler will double their stake?  Triple?  Go from a stake of \\$50 to \\$250?  Does it matter how big the initial stake and goal are?  For example, how to the results compare when stake = \\$10 and goal = \\$20, versus when  stake = \\$100 and goal = \\$200?  What patterns can you see in the number of flips needed?

The probability of tripling the gambler's stake tapers off at around 0.33. As one would expect, the size of the initial stake and hopeful goal obviously matter when speculating the probability of winning on each of these games. As the stake and goal get farther apart, the probability of winning goes down. One experiment I ran was with a stake of $10 and a goal of $20, resulting in a winning prob. of 0.5 and an average of 101 flips. On the other hand, a stake of $100 and a goal of $200 resulted in a prob of  0.49 but an average flip number of 9,998. Another experiment I ran was checking the probability of winning and average number of flips for a stake of $50 and a goal of $250. This resulted in a probability of 0.2008 and the average number of flips clocking in at around 10,100. The pattern would be that the percentage increase/change between a stake and goal across experiments will likely allow the winning prob. to be similar; the average number of flips to end the game, however, will largely depend on how large the stake and goal themselves are.These experiments were all done with a Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 trials."],"metadata":{"id":"Ml8Xcp4wNbaK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1-Kcaq5ImE9o"},"source":["Problem 2 :  Numerical Integration - Trapezoid Rule.
